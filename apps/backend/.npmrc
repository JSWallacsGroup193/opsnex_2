# Temporary Audit Exception (Added: October 21, 2025)
# =========================================================
# GHSA-9965-vmph-33xx / CVE-2025-56200 - validator.js URL validation bypass
# GHSA-67mh-4wv8-2f99 - esbuild development server vulnerability
# 
# Why these exceptions exist:
# - validator.js: No official patch available as of Oct 21, 2025
#   - Affects URL validation only (moderate severity)
#   - Our app uses class-validator for email/string/number validation
#   - Low actual risk to production
# - esbuild: Development-only vulnerability, not exposed in production
#
# TODO: Remove these exceptions once patches are released:
# - validator.js: Monitor https://github.com/validatorjs/validator.js/releases
# - esbuild: Monitor https://github.com/evanw/esbuild/releases
# =========================================================

# Set audit level to critical - only block on critical vulnerabilities
